# Option Logic Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed:

### 1. **Missing Event Listeners for Checkbox Inputs**
- **Problem**: The option visibility update was not being triggered properly for checkbox inputs because the event listener wasn't set up correctly for checkbox groups.
- **Fix**: Added separate handling for checkbox inputs to attach event listeners to each checkbox in the group individually.

### 2. **Incorrect Option Selector Logic**
- **Problem**: The selector for options in `updateOptionVisibility` function didn't properly handle different input types (radio, checkbox, select).
- **Fix**: Updated the function to properly select radio/checkbox option containers (`.radio-option, .checkbox-option`) and select options separately.

### 3. **Incomplete Option Logic Updates**
- **Problem**: When options were added/removed in the form builder, the option logic rules weren't being updated properly.
- **Fix**: 
  - Added event listeners to option inputs for real-time updates
  - Updated `updateOptionLogicOptions` function to handle cases where no options are available yet
  - Fixed the filtering logic for option rules to use proper validation

### 4. **Missing Input Validation and Error Handling**
- **Problem**: The option logic rules could have invalid structures that caused the visibility logic to fail silently.
- **Fix**: 
  - Added proper validation for rule structure (checking for valid source question, source value, and hidden options)
  - Added debugging console logs to help track what's happening
  - Added better error handling for edge cases

### 5. **Timing Issues with Option Visibility**
- **Problem**: Option visibility wasn't being checked at the right time when questions loaded.
- **Fix**: Added a small delay using `setTimeout` to ensure DOM elements are properly rendered before applying visibility rules.

### 6. **Unchecking Hidden Options**
- **Problem**: When options were hidden, they remained checked, which could cause confusion.
- **Fix**: Added logic to automatically uncheck radio buttons and reset select values when options are hidden.

## How to Test the Fix:

1. **Create a form with multiple questions**:
   - Question 1: Multiple choice with options "Yes" and "No"
   - Question 2: Multiple choice with options "Option A", "Option B", "Option C"

2. **Set up Option Logic**:
   - In Question 2, add an option rule that hides "Option C" when Question 1 = "No"

3. **Test the behavior**:
   - Preview the form
   - Answer "No" to Question 1
   - Go to Question 2 and verify that "Option C" is hidden
   - Go back and change Question 1 to "Yes"
   - Return to Question 2 and verify that "Option C" is now visible

## Additional Improvements:

- Added console logging for debugging (can be removed in production)
- Improved validation of option rules
- Better handling of dynamic option updates
- Enhanced user experience by automatically unchecking hidden options

The option logic should now work properly for all supported question types (multiple choice, checkboxes, dropdowns, and Likert scales).
